# ECE470_BOBOTS

This repo stores the code for the ECE470 Team BOBOTS project. These source files used in conjunction with UR3 drivers allow for the simulation of a UR3 robot in ROS. The Team BOBOTS robot will serve as a pick and place robot, detecting colored straws and placing them into the appropriate boba drinks.

**Project Update 1:**
- Installed ROS and other neccessary packages on personal Ubuntu 16.04 system
- Created and successfully built catkin workspace with the UR3 drivers and code from previous labs
- Integrated previous lab code to successfully control the movements of the robot through forward kinematics

**Delivrable 2 Update:**
- Fixed various integration issued that were left unaddressed from the last deliverable
- Integrated inverse kinematics using code from previous labs
- Added camera sensor input functionality to allow for decision making based on the robot's surroundings
- Connected all added components to allow for basic pick and place operations on simple blocks
